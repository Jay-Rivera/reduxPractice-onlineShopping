# React Redux Product Store

A practice e-commerce application built with React, Redux Toolkit, React Router DOM, and Bootstrap.

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of global state management with Redux Toolkit while becoming more comfortable with responsive UI development using Bootstrap.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

Gain hands-on experience with Redux Toolkit

Practice managing asynchronous state with a fake API

Improve routing structure using React Router DOM

Strengthen layout and styling skills with Bootstrap

Build confidence with scalable React application structure

This is a learning-focused project built to deepen my understanding of Redux patterns and state flow in real-world applications.

## What I Practiced

Creating and structuring Redux slices

Using createSlice

Managing async logic (thunks)

Connecting components with useSelector and useDispatch

Structuring routes with React Router

Building responsive UI layouts with Bootstrap

Separating concerns between UI and global state
